## Introduction

For this Art Jam Response, I explored three projects made by my classmates. Each one offered a completely different way of using p5.js to create interactive experiences. What I found most interesting wasn’t just the technical execution but the way each student’s personality came through in the way they used visuals, interaction, and structure. Even with simple tools, these works showed how many creative directions are possible.

## Project 1: “Shy guy who is very shy!”

What stood out to me most in this project is the level of expression achieved through code. The student created different facial expressions using p5, which is something I still struggle with myself. My own artistic ideas often feel limited by my current technical skills, so I found this piece genuinely impressive. The way the character reacts to user interaction felt thoughtful and cohesive. There’s the ability to turn the light off, move the head, slide the red bar, and each of those triggers a different expression. It’s not just a set of disconnected actions because everything ties into a theme of light and mood, which gives the piece an identity. I really admire how the facial expressions shift with each action, making it feel alive and narrative-driven. This is something I’d like to work toward in my own future projects.
