## Introduction

I played through three projects done by classmates, each offering a unique perspective on the original frogfrogfrog sketch game. Overall, what struck me was how each person reimagined the mechanics in his or her own way while still working within the confines of the assignment. Even though they all had to do with catching flies, the ways people approached it were actually pretty different. Some were more visually-based, some took the game in interesting directions, and others incorporated completely new systems into the game. Watching these different takes really helped me think back to my own game and what kind of design choices I make.

## Project 1: “Catching Flies” by Ray-ux514

What got my attention right away with this project was the visual direction. The student used this really minimal stroke-based art style that just feels super clean and cohesive. Everything from the background to the UI just uses the same simple look, giving the whole game a sense of intentionality. But what really impressed me was how the simplicity went all the way down to the gameplay choices. Instead of moving the frog freely with the mouse, the player moves around by clicking one of three lily pads. This completely changes the rhythm of the game and adds a level of simplicity that even more so than the original (Even though the original is simple in it of itself). It's something I did not consider in my own project, as I focused most of my effort on polishing the fundementals due to my skillset rather than reinventing movement. To see someone re-think such a basic interaction really made me realize that sometimes the best ideas come from constraints. Overall, the clarity of the visuals and the originality of the movement system made this project stand out for me.

## Project 2: “Chateau Jose” by Abhinav Voleti

This is a project that immediately grabbed my attention due to the Pokemon and Mario references. On top of this, I really appreciated the workflow behind it—creating assets outside of code and then importing them into p5.js is something I also did for my own game, so it was interesting to see someone take a similar route. The most memorable feature here was the “two game modes” idea where instead of only playing as the frog, you can also play as the fly and try to avoid being eaten. It's not multiplayer, but the two perspectives make it feel like a fuller experience. I thought it was creative how toggling the character automatically changes the goal, controls, and sense of challenge. It's a smart way to differentiate the game from everyone else's without adding any unnecessary complexity.

## Project 3: “Fly Frog” by gargamelleUWU

Right from the start, this project stood out because the menu itself is interactive since you have to use the frog's tongue to select menu options. I really enjoyed that as a design choice because it makes you learn the core controls before the game has even started. It's a very subtle but really clever way to teach the player by interaction rather than instruction. Game-wise, this project brought in a lot of innovation with the consequences of missing, which I found really unique. In most versions of the frog game, you miss a fly, and you just miss out on a point. In this case, the tongue hits thorns at the top of the screen and hurts the frog. It opens a whole new layer of tension, and precision does count a great deal more. I also liked the little additions—the moving background and the color-customizable frog. Even trivial touches make this game alive. Overall, it felt like a very thoughtful and polished reinterpretation of the original goal but adds more in terms of losing instead of winning.

## Final Thoughts

These projects taught me something different about how flexible a simple sketch can become. Catching Flies showed me how a small change in movement can reshape the whole gameplay experience. Chateau Jose reminded me that visual style and personal inspiration can completely alter the tone of a project. And Fly Frog demonstrated how adding risk and consequence creates deeper engagement. Seeing the range of ideas helped me better understand my own decisions in my Mod Jam project, and it made me appreciate how much creativity can come from reimagining the same starting point.
