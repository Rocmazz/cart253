## Attribution
For the new references i never tried before:

arc() & angleMode() – I used this to draw the smile in my self-portrait. Unlike ellipse() or line(), arc() lets you draw part of a circle, which made it perfect for shaping a curved mouth instead of a full oval. I also set the angle mode to degrees for the smile to be only 180.

pmouseX / pmouseY – I used these inside mouseDragged() to leave a trail following the cursor. pmouse gives the previous mouse position, so by drawing between mouseX/mouseY and pmouseX/pmouseY, the cursor movement leaves behind a continuous line instead of just single dots.
